# final-project-s17-empire
Puja Soni (pds7yx) and Charu Mishra (cm2jk)

Milestone:
we built all of the screens for the app and built the seques to connect the screens to each other.
We worked on our main screen (the calendar) and connecting it to the day's journal entry that shows all the memories from that day. We haven't made it so that it saves to a specific day yet though. 
We want to have a calendar view that resembles the iOS calendar that people are familiar with so we tried to integrate a cocoapod (JTAppleCalender) into our project. We have one issue left with it so as of right now, our screen shows the original datePicker we were using as a placeholder.
